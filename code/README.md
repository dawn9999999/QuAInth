## Code

This repository contains 3 folders, which are "aqps", "evaluate" and "llms".

The folder "aqps" contains the source program used by this repository to verify the effect annotations generation. There are 4 APQs, which are Bernstein-Vazirani(BV), Deutsch-Jozsa(DJ), Groverâ€™s search (GS), and the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).

The folder "llms" aims to deploy different LLMs and design the prompts used in this repository. It contains the code for Deepseek, Llama and Qwen.

The folder "evaluate" contains the code used to evaluate the effectiveness of annotations from different metrics, and the code about the annotation fusion. The files `rogue.py`, `cos.py`, `judge.py` and `total_score.py` correspond to the metrics *RF1*, *CS*, *QS*, and *FS*, respectively. The file `combine.py` is used to fuse the annotations generated by different LLMs.
